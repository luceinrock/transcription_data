 Thank you for calling Morgan and Morgan. My name is Kermaine on a recorded line. Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with? Miss Singh, Ruby Singh. I'm so sorry. I'm having a tough time hearing you. Can you repeat that for me? As said, Ruby, are you B1? Singh, S-A-I. So that's Ruby Singh, S-I-N-G? No, Singh, S-A-I-N. Okay, thank you for that. I can hear you better now. Would you be able to provide me your date of birth? 92136. And can I get a good phone number for you just in case I call or to drop? I have a phone number ending in 4850. Is that the correct number? Okay, perfect. I just wanted to confirm because sometimes the phone number that shows up on our caller ID isn't the accurate number. So we'd like to ask just to make sure. Miss Ruby, are you calling in about an auto accident? No, somebody called me. Okay, so have you inquired about an auto accident case with Morgan and Morgan? That was a long time ago. Okay, so you don't wish to get a consultation today? Yeah, I can. Okay, one moment. All right, Mr. Ruby, would you be able to tell me about this car accident? What cause the accident to happen? Someone ran into you? Did they run into the back of your car? Okay, and when did this accident happen? Okay, do you remember what month? No. I can't remember. All right, Miss Ruby, so to complete the consultation today, I would need some information like the day and when and where it happened. Do you think if I called you back at a later time, you would have some more of the information? Yeah, my near food should be a way to answer all your questions. Yeah, so when should I give you a call back so we can continue the consultation? In the afternoon. In the afternoon, how about 4pm? Does that work? It sounds good. Okay, perfect. I'm going to go ahead and schedule call back for 4pm. Okay, Miss Ruby? Okay. Thank you. All right, thank you so much for taking our call. You have a great rest of your day. All right, bye-bye.
