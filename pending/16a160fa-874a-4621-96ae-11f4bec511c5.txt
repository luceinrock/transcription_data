I just wanted
 to double check on something. As far as legal representation, the attorney
 that you spoke with never got back to you after that initial consultation.
 Hello. Yes, I'm here. Okay, were you? I'm sorry. What is this? No. They did
 not. Okay. All right. And you haven't had any other legal representation
 since this. Correct. No. Okay. Thank you so much. It'll be just another
 moment, My do have a really brief question.
 Do you currently live with anyone with uninsured motorist coverage? No.
 Okay. Not a problem. I remember them saying that they know who it was. Oh, I
 see. And we don't know if they listed him on the police report itself. No.
 Okay. Mrs. Johnson,
 thank you again for your patience. Can you hear me? Yes. Okay, no further
 questions for you. But as soon as I hear from the attorney, I'm going to
 reach out to you right away. Would that be okay? Okay. Okay, wonderful. Is
 there a particular time or date that you don't want me to reach out? Any
 time. Any time. Okay, I appreciate the availability. Is there anything else
 I can help you with at this moment? No. All right. You made the right
 choice. Okay. I have one question. Yes, I do have a question. Why was that
 contact? Now regarding this accident, just curious. You know that I was
 curious as well because I, you and I spoke because the other person had
 connected us together. I didn't. I didn't. That's the thing. So I'm just
 hoping that this is illegal. I don't know. 
 So I, I'm not 100% sure. Absolutely. So as soon as I
 hear from the attorney, I will be letting you know of their decision. Okay.
 All right. Okay. All right. Thank you again for your time, ma'am. Call us if
 you need anything at all. Would you like the number?
