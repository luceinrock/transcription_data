It was in a construction center. And your client just couldn't stop in time. And when I had stopped there to make a left turn. And while I was there in the lane, he ran into the back of me. Wow. My name is so sorry. So you said you were turning and you mentioned your client. What do you mean? Your client? Do you mean the other party? The other driver? You're well, you're it. Well, don't you have insurance? Aren't you taking care of the insurance for this fellow that ran into me? I don't know. I mean, this is more like a Morgan Law firm. Have you heard that we are representing the other driver? Have I heard what? This is more going to Morgan Law firm. We're not the insurance company. We're a lawyer's office. What am I doing talking with you? Well, you called out. You called for an attorney. No, I did not call. Absolutely not. I didn't call any of that. Okay. So then there seems to be misunderstanding here. Because this is Morgan and Morgan Law firm. So we thought you were, you know, this is, you know, we could help you if you needed a representation on this case. But if that's the case, yeah. If you thought you were calling the insurance company. I didn't think anything. I didn't call anybody. Somebody put me on the phone with you. I want to know why these people called you for me. So that didn't call you. Yeah, I'm not sure exactly who called you. Yeah. They transferred you over to me. So yeah, whoever called you. They transferred the call over to me. No, I don't need a law. I don't need you for a lawyer. I have a law. I've got lawyers of my own. And if I wanted to have one, I'd have one that I knew. Got it. I don't need you for a lawyer. I don't need you to protect me. Okay. Here you can just go. The police. The police came and there was plenty of people right there in the road as a construction site that saw this happen. I have gone over this. We're at least one dozen times with this insurance company. I don't know what their problem is. But I just don't know what is what's wrong with them. And why they can't pay for my call to be fixed when they told me the man had insurance with them. Can you explain such a thing? I don't know. I don't even know what's going on here. Why did they contact you? So basically whoever called you, they thought that you were looking for an attorney to help you with this case. So that's why they connected you to us. What if we can. I want the insurance. I want this insurance company to pay to get my truck fixed. And I'll leave it there. I'm lost. I want them to do what they supposed to be doing and pay to get my truck fixed. So they're applying it ran into my truck. Can you understand that much? Yes, no, I understand that. Do you want to do you want to solve this case then or not? Absolutely not. Why would I ask you? I have a lawyer if I need one. Okay. I'll pick my home. They don't want to pick one for me. Sounds good. Do you have any questions for me? Hello? Hello? Hello? Can you hear me? Hello? Can you hear me?
