And to add insult to injury, they fought him very hard. We got to see firsthand the consequences of having a life changing injury when you're poor and when you hire a terrible lawyer. Tim got really beat up and I became outraged. And I decided then and there that I would only ever do this type of work. And we're going to have a lot of fun. We're going to represent the people, not the powerful. Morgan and Morgan is the largest personal injury firm in the world here to serve you wherever you are, whatever you need.
