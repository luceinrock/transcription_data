Yeah, it's like, there was a liability only. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Okay, man. Well, being the only, it's only liability on that insurance. That means that there wouldn't be any of that. We would recover our compensation because that's just the minimum insurance that's required. As well as, you know, having any insurance, there's no insurance company that's going to respond for your personal injury. Do they cover your medical expenses or do they do anything? Yeah. They covered your medical school. Okay. I am. I mean, that's as far as long as that they're going to cover, but they wouldn't be able to provide you with the compensation. Since it's only liability.
