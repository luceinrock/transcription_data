Over 30 years ago Morgan and Morgan started with just two lawyers. But our mission started years before that. When I was younger, my brother Tim was paralyzed and my family ended up hiring the wrong lawyer. And to add insult to injury, they fought him very hard. We got to see firsthand the consequences of having a life changing injury when you're poor and when you hire a terrible lawyer. Tim got really beat up. And I became a lawyer. I became outraged. And I decided then and there that I would only ever do this type of work and represent the people not the powerful.
