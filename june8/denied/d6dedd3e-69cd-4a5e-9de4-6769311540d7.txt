Actually, right data in the accident that I would have to get my phone and they call you back. We're going back to get that part of the information. How did the how did the accident happen? Well, we wait for the green light at telephone road and I may not know. Uh, not even a year ago was turning left. You're going to offer a student card report for the long. They finally crossed the street. Well, drivers had a pattern. They went ahead call the driver on one side. Here's a new truck. The monster truck. It's unlike a file. The new truck did not have insurance. So therefore we put the leg because the lady officer that hit the man kind of playing the people. The truck that hit us. They're trying to get out without a plan. They told that we were going to fail the time. It was a surf ball. There's nothing that's to get a point. When after about 30 minutes later. Has to host a block. No, no, no, nothing. They kind of did our undercover action and time looking. And they the car was flying. When they bounce off, she was flying with a car. And the land in our car almost the top of the hood, but they got the host side of the car. We showed both of our work. Completely not bad. Um, they said we're going to pay. I went to therapy. My brother went to law. And this goes. Our two clothes to pay. I don't know what's going on. They told us that then they had up to so many years to pay. They should kind of let their own insurance into that. My brother. I don't know if he still was at the end. He had an electric motor. He got here. He was lost. My. She got better be quiet.

Well, that's why do you go ahead, doctor? You know, I've never find it in the turn. Will. Will you go after the city of the police department? Seems like everybody want to do.
