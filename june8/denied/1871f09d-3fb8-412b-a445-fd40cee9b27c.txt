No. I did get a brief little summary. Sounds like you were involved in an accident. What back in March? Yeah. It is like March or April. I'm not exactly sure. But you were a... Yes. Yes. Okay. And as far as you remember, what happened? Okay. We were coming down Route 7 on the highway. And when we were coming down, there was you know what I mean? She didn't want to be like stuck without not knowing who it was. And then finally we blew our horn, blow our horn, finally they pulled over. And then we sat there waiting to state how we patrol came. They made a report and everything. And that was that was about it. But the only thing is I have I know I had a concussion, but we had to get my nephew and I didn't get to the hospital right there. Oh, okay. I started getting my dreams all the time. I didn't have to do with that or something else. And then my neck was killing me. But also my back. But I was diagnosed with sciatic. Three years ago. So I don't have to do with that. Or with that, was just from. Sure. Okay. And who was driving you said that was your mom? Yes. Okay. And do you know what has happened with the vehicle? Was it fixed? Like I said, my. My. My. Like I said, my. My door was. The. Characters. I didn't get it. See, if they wouldn't move over, she would have hit the brick wall. But she didn't. Her side didn't get hit. It was my side. They got hit. Like I couldn't even open my door. Okay. So she was okay. Yeah. Okay. Got it. And. And when. And when. Going to your family. It'll be a state. It's the state. How am I. Patrol because it was on. And. And. What's up? Seven. And. What's up? What's up? What's your mom's last name? The same as Martin. Stracken. SCRA. H. A. N. Yeah. That's what I was searching for. Okay. Well, for some reason it's not coming up in their big database. For the month of March or April. The action didn't happen in May, right? I mean, you could check it. I thought it was. I thought it was April, but it could be May. I know what you said. Maybe. May. Yeah. Nothing coming up. Okay. Um. And. And. And. Try to contact you about your injury. Yeah. They have been contacted. They haven't contacted me at all. And my mom, she won't even like, because I'm on her insurance, but like as far as like if I was driving, you know what I mean, but I wasn't. But she won't even like let me even contact them at all. So. And that's why I don't understand why she's that being like, I don't understand why she's feeling that because she says that I could, because I can pay my own medical bills. She doesn't want her. Her insurance went up. This is what she told me. Yeah. But she wasn't a fault. So I don't want to. But if she was, she wasn't even a fault. So I don't understand how it would go up. And if it was, it's regardless. Yeah. That's strange. I mean, you haven't actually seen the police report though. Um, I, they sent her a copy of it. Um, I, I mean, I could try to get it. Okay. Yeah. I mean, I, I'm guessing that the other person wasn't found to be a because we were there for like two out. We were just like an hour and a half because the sheriff had pulled up because like she was like on the highway and she stayed there and waited until the stay away patrol came. So. And they just, there's. They were at bulk, but he had, they had the guy had progressed to the same insurance. I think your thing was John. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. John something. Okay. Yeah. Like I said, you went to your family doctor one time, right? Yeah. And, and are you still feeling the effects of like a spread? Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I, that's what I mean. Yeah. I'm, that's what I'm saying. I, I've been getting my insurance. And so, and that's when my boyfriend told me that it could be from, I could have got a concussion from that. I didn't even think about like think that that had something to do with it. You know, so that could be possible or. I don't know. Okay. Okay. Yeah. So then have you ever needed to how you were a personal injury attorney in the past? Yeah. Okay. So, so here's how we operate. Okay. When we get involved, you know, we don't charge you anything upfront or any kind of hourly rate. You know, we only get paid if we win. You know, and we do that by breaking a percentage of any kind of settlement that we get. So, and that percentage is one third. Okay. So, you know, if, if progressive gives you a check for nine grand, our fee is supposed to be three. You know, pretty straightforward there. Okay. Doing, you know, investigating the claim, you know, gathering evidence and we can even refer you to somebody to help you with your head. You need be. Okay. Okay. Yeah. That'd be great. Yeah. Because under her insurance, it says like I think it was like $25,000 for like passengers. Like it's like up to, you know, and I mean like, which I mean, I would like, I guess that's if you get like her badly or whatever. So like I'm like, that's the limit of the policy. The minimum amount of insurance you need to carry, you know, Ohio is up to 25 grand. Right. And that's the limit. You know, that doesn't mean that you get 25 grand. That just means that. Yeah. Yeah. I just think, you know, if that had something that had something to do with her, no, I wouldn't expect that much. I just want to figure out what I'm going to have 90 to understand why my mom, but my mom wasn't at all at all. She wasn't. They hit my door. I the passenger, the front passenger door and then they kept going. Okay. Okay. So let me get some information from you. What's the phone number for you? For me, 740, 381, 3430. The best time to call me those after 2.30. Okay. And what's what's a good mailing address for you? 526 North Forest Street Unit 2 Toronto. I'm sorry. Was that North Forest Street? North Forest. North Forest. FOURTH. Yes. Street Unit 2 Toronto, Ohio. 43964. Okay. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to send my documents to your cell phone, you know, the docuSign. Okay. Is that okay? Yeah.

I mean, you can text them to me. Do I just send them back to the same number as you text them to me? Well, it's docuSign. So you don't have to worry about that.
