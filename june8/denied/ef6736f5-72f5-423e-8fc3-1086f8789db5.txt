I'm trying to get her. I was in the city and I was hit. But it's quite a while ago. So that's why I'm not sure. Were you rear-ended? Did you get T-bone? I'm trying to think back now. But I would say rear-ended. And you can't recall if you were in the city. You were at a stop light at an intersection with a stop sign. I would say at this point, because it's a while ago, but I would say I was, I thought I would stop for a light. Okay. And what injuries did you sustain? Let's see. That was a while ago. So I'm not sure. I don't know if it was in my shoulder. Right. What shoulder would you say? Right. I probably went to my primary care provider, I would say. It's been a while. So I'm not sure. But I'd, that's usually what I would do. Do you recall if you ever got X-rays or anything like that? Hmm. She has been a while ago. I assume I probably did. Are you still suffering from any injuries from the accident? Oh, no, it seems to be better now. Yes. Were you reaching out because of treatment for your injuries or because of, to do something to do with insurance? Hmm. I'm not sure. It's been a while ago. That's why. Well, what are you calling for? Do you know? Let's see. Well, I was, the attorney, I think, told me to call for shoulder because of my shoulder pain. So you are still having some problems with the shoulder? Yes.

Or December? Oh, yeah. Oh, boy. It's been a such a while ago. I would say it would be probably in the fall. Okay. So maybe September? Yeah, I would say. Yeah. Did you report it to your insurance company? It's been a while ago. So I'm not sure. I probably did. I don't think so. I may report it, but I don't think that, you know, we had any extra, you know, anything from from please. You made a verb, please report though. I believe, I believe so. Yes. It's been a while ago. That's why I'm trying to think about it. Yeah. That's okay. Let me see. It's been so long ago. I would assume that probably wasn't here in Clifton Park. I'm not sure. That's where I am.

So I'm sucking up the moment while I can. Yeah, I can imagine. Yeah. So you said an attorney told you to reach out to someone in regards to your shoulder pain. What's your attorney told you that? Oh, gosh. I don't know. It was a while ago. I have to check it. See, I might have it written down somewhere. Okay. I can always give you a bus. Could I give you a bus on that? It's okay.

Over 30 years ago, Morgan and Morgan started with just two lawyers. But our mission started years before that. When I was younger, my brother Tim was paralyzed and my family ended up hiring the wrong lawyer. And I had insult to injury. They fought him very hard. We got to see firsthand the consequences of having a life changing injury when you're poor and when you hire a terrible lawyer. Tim got really beat up and I became outraged. And I decided then and there that I would only ever do this type of work and represent the people, not the powerful.
