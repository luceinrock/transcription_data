 So... I'll see you in some more pictures. I can't hear you say to the music. Thank you for following all of us. This is lovely speaking. May I just do it? Yeah, of course, we're in Mickey Jones from Florida and the zip code is 32189. We had a car accident that was parked this year 2023. So this is a new case. Can you see this further? Okay. Hello. Oh, hi there. Yes, hi, ma'am. How are you today? I'm sorry, ma'am. I didn't cry. I'm touched. Did you hear me? What was the date of the accident again? And what city was that in? Put them down. You said, lock them up. I'm sorry, you said put them down. And where you alone at the time of the accident? Did you have any past years with you, ma'am? Well, my fiance was the one that was driving. And then my granddaughter's mother was there. I don't know if it was supposed to, I don't know. Also, my back started hurting then. Really bad. So my daughter sent me to a page for it. Okay, you say your doctor sent you to a plane, a plane clinic, ma'am? Yes, ma'am. Okay. And can you just verify your personal last name? Well, one more time, again, for me. Vicki Jones. And that's V-I-C-K-Y. I-E. I-E, okay. And the 3-8-6-3-8-5-6-071, that's the best number to reach to, ma'am. Yes, ma'am. Did you want to provide a secondary number or just that one? Just this one. And did you have any email that you wanted to provide, ma'am? No, ma'am. No problem. And did you want to provide a mailing address like a resident solar P.O. Box? Well, I tried to give him the one that, um, that the 911 call gave to us was 325 Pluto, 4th, Fetchum of Florida, 3211. Thank you, ma'am. Okay. You said 325 Pluto, 4th? Yes. P? Yes. And the zip code is 32189. Yes, ma'am. All right, give me just one moment. I'm gonna go ahead and connect you over for the consultation with the attorney, okay? Okay. Thank you. What happened to the 300-go to work? Mr. Cook? Oh, okay. Because the 1-12-30, we used the 2-12-30, we don't start cooking, so too. Hello? Hello. Hello. Hi. Hi, how are you today? My name is Manium. Sorry to hear. It wasn't exactly in that habit. So tell me what exactly happened. Yes. Well, we were setting it. My granddaughter dropped to her mom. And so we had to be here for off. And the next thing I know, a guy named Jacob, he hit the van, but nobody was allowed to say it was him because he ain't got no license. But he's old lady. Did he have insurance? But it'd be in his washroom. Okay. Was the vehicle on his wife's name? I guess. Okay. Have you ever had an attorney for this case or received any medical care? No. Okay. You don't receive any medical care at all. I got your phone clinic now. Okay. When did you start that? Four days, now it's about two weeks after the accident. And do you have a copy of the police report? Do you have a copy of the police report? It's out in the van. Would you be able to obtain a copy of the police report? So I can review it. Yeah. Oh, just a minute. What is that? And how many times have you seen the pain management document shown? Sorry. Three times. Yeah. And do you have further appointments? I go every month. Okay. And what exactly happened with the driver? I know you said that the driver didn't have a license. So what happened when the police officer arrived? So the one that hit us, the one that hit us, he didn't have no license. So his wife had to come out the door and say it was her. Because she's got the license. She's got the insurance. She don't have enough. We will be able to go up to 30 to the general. Because we know it ain't going to take long to anytime. I'm working on it too. you
