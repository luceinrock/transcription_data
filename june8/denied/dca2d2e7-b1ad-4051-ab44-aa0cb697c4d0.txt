Had a lady get into it with me over pronunciation. And I was like, I was horrible because, you know, I mean, there are plenty of people here in the state of Florida that I don't understand. Even though we're all speaking English. And she's like, well, honey, you're in the wrong business if you can't understand. I was like, you know, I did look at how we just went. It's Canning'sburg, but we both were going Canning'sburg. And I can only write down what I hear. But anyway. Anyway. We're all just trying to make it happen. When did the accident occur, man? It's been, I think it was last year. 2022. It was either 21 or 22. Yeah. But you're not sure of the date. Right. I still have things from difficult for the other representative to listen to you. I mean, without getting back into the detail, you were in a multi-car accident. And I'm, I'm a some, the result of that you were injured. Yeah, I did my knee and I had severe bruising on my chest. Okay. Okay. Chest. You were alone. So I'm trying to find it on my computer. Okay. And you say, your knee and your chest, what was it? The writer left me. It was my left knee. Left knee. Okay. It happened 12 December of 2021. Okay. December 12, 2021. Okay. And after the accident, did you seek any treatment? They had me go to the ER when I fell down my knee just let. Let go. Okay. Did you, they give you X-rays? They X-rayed my knee. Yes. Okay. And any pain medication? No. Okay. And you say you were in this multi-vehicle accident where you re-rended? I was at the ER and didn't know, but I re-rended the lady in front of me trying to stop. Okay. Just being. Yeah. And- Okay. That's what I need. All right, 11, 8, 2021. And you- so a car stopped- or a vehicle stopped abruptly in front of you and caused you to slam on your brakes and rear end them? The one- it was like- the work- work- pickup track just stopped dead in the middle of the road for no reason whatsoever. And then this vehicle behind him, he put her brakes on and the vehicle behind her, put her brakes on and I did too and I slammed in that vehicle in front of me. But the work truck just sped off. They laughed at scene. And what you were ended was another car or a truck. It was like a shoot. Our SUV- It had a big wheel on the back of it. Yeah, like a SUV. Okay. Okay. So this was in traffic and a truck stop abruptly and cause- see, to rear end the car slash- in front of her. Okay. Got that part. And you say the at fault party did a hit and run. Okay. And this was a commercial vehicle. All right. Let's go back up. Okay. We're going to go back up in- in- Ken and Spurt. Well, it happened in- in Ken and Spurt, Kentucky, right? Yes. On an over- 60. Let's get that in here. And you know what type of truck that was that ran off? It was a white pickup truck. It was a company truck. Okay. All right. Okay. Did the police come out to the scene in the accident? Oh, yes, they did. Yeah. The day issue you a ticket? No. Okay. And part is speaking with us today. Go ahead. Well, I'm kind of explaining it. If it was a fault state and you were seriously injured, then you would have to wait for the at fault parties insurance to compensate you for injuries and whatever else. Maybe chargeable. And sometimes it takes them a long time to respond. So you could actually, you know, suffer seriously waiting for treatment because you don't- if you didn't have any money. But if it's no fault, you can start everything. And with your own insurance, they'll figure out who's at fault later and then the two insurance companies will deal with each other. They'll, you know, pay each other off whatever it takes. But at least you don't have to wait to get treated. All right. And then in some cases where if the police didn't, there's no serious injuries, they might not even come out. Yeah. Yeah. It's- It has its pluses and it has its minuses. Yeah. If there's real severe injury, then they'll, then, you know, they're going to do this. Go the fault route, who did it, and what were they driving and all of that stuff. But no fault or not, you can still get an attorney for an injury case. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The basic liability. And that's what the other woman had too. Yeah. Well, in some cases, depends on what happened and how it happened. The attorneys can actually surpass the limits of policies. Yeah. So yeah. Let me see here. Let me get the rest of the city in. Where is it? Oh, come on. I'm in Kentucky. How come Cannon's Berge is not showing up? I don't know. Yeah. It's like I picked the state. And then after I picked the state, there's a drop down for all of the cities in that state. See, oh, and in. And what do I have? I have cold iron, Columbus, Columbia, Cones, Conflonts, Corbin. Huh. There's no cannon. All right. You know what? I'm going to have to go to the closest. All right. Let's see. Who's close by? Ashland. Cannon's bird. You say Ashland. I'm just going to minimize. There's Ashland, Ashland animal rescue. Okay. That's the closest one. It looks like. Ashland. See how that comes out. Ashland. He got it. Got to work. And part of speaking with us, no current or previous legal episode. Is there any presentation for this matter by an attorney? Correct. Right. All right. And as of yet, you haven't accepted any offers to settle for painting, suffering injuries and losses. No. Correct. Okay. Did your airbags deploy? Yes. Again, my driver's airbags. Okay. And this may be a stretch of a question, but they do require me to ask. Might you have a question? Maybe you have been on the clock working when the accident occurred. Yeah. Okay. And were there any other passengers, or any other people in the vehicle with you beside yourself? No. All right. Let me forward this over for a quick summary. Bear with you a moment. Okay. So based on the information you provided, in the conversation we've just had, I have a brief summary to read to you. Want to make sure I've captured the details. If by chance, something's incorrect. Let me know and we'll, we'll make the correction together. Okay. All right. So it says, you were in an auto accident on November 8th, 2021 in Ashland, Kentucky, or somewhere close by. This was a multi vehicle accident. And you were the driver of your vehicle. Your injuries include your left knee and chest area. You were not found at fault. You have not had an attorney for this accident and you have not accepted any type of settlement additionally. You have treated for some of your injuries. Since you went to the ER, there was impact to the front of your vehicle. And the police were called. But they didn't, they didn't come out, right? The police came out. Yes. All the put, okay. Let me change that. And so the police were called and they did come to the scene of the accident. Is that all correct? Yes. All right. Let's send it over. All right. So this matter looks like it's going to have to go under a brief review with our review team here. Which basically means I'm going to ask you a few more questions. After that, I'm going to ask you a few more questions. I'll put you on a brief hold. I'm going to reach out to them, have them take a look and see if they'll give us the authorization to go forward. Okay. All right. So next question is, are you presently under any kind of ongoing treatment for your injuries? Do you have any follow-ups to do anything like that? Yes. I have a doctor Jones, but I haven't seen him for a while. Okay. So are you planning to see him again in regards to your knee and chest? No. Okay. When was the last time you went in for treatment for either your knee or your chest? I believe it was in the chest. You couldn't have had treatment prior to being injured. But I got the year wrong. Did you get a police report? No, I didn't. Okay. And as you said on your insurance, you only have basic coverage, right? Right. Depends for my medical. Okay. And let's go. Let's go.

The policy number are the, they call it the claim number. Not the claim number, your actual policy number. Yeah, you had a policy number long before you got a claim number for the incident. They should be two different numbers. Unless, unless state farm is using policies for claims, some insurance may do that occasionally. But most of the time, they're two separate numbers.

I'm just. Too long. But our mission started years before that when I was younger. My brother Tim was paralyzed. And my family ended up hiring the wrong lawyer. And to add insult to injury, they fought him very hard. We got to see firsthand the consequences of having a life changing injury. When you're poor. And when you hire a terrible lawyer, Tim got really beat up and I became outraged. And I decided then and there that I would only ever do this type of work and represent the people. Not. The powerful Morgan and Morgan is the largest personal injury firm in the world here to serve you. Wherever you are, whatever you need with an army of over 800 attorneys, thousands of caring support staff, unrivaled technology, investigators and experts across the country. We are everywhere for everyone. Morgan and Morgan is not only America's largest injury law firm, but we're also very much a local law firm with branch offices right here in your community. Wherever you are, whatever you need, whether you or someone you love was injured in a car crash, the victim of medical malpractice had a child born with a devastating birth injury, denied social security benefits, had your home or business insurance claims, denied, fell in a public or private space or even injured on the job. Our attorneys are here for you. Millions of people just like you call us every year for help when they need it the most. And we've recovered billions of dollars. We have the resources, reach and reputation to take on the biggest bullies to get you the biggest results. Some people think our law firm only takes on the biggest cases with the most serious injuries. The truth is, many of our cases involve car crashes, slip and falls and work injuries. But here's the thing. What makes us different is that we don't actually believe those cases are small. Even a low-speed crash is a big problem. Or a slip and fall can cause serious injuries that last a lifetime. And a lifetime is a long time. For over 30 years, we've never backed out from going up against the biggest insurance companies and powerful corporations who sold harmful and dangerous products or medications. We're a new agent. This is not a case our firm is going to be able to assist you with. They're not stating that you don't totally have a case, but they are stating that we're not in a position to go forward. And that since you were referred to us, if you're looking for legal counsel, you might want to... Actually, you said someone called you, but you don't know who they were. Right. Yeah. So you would have to either do a local search or... I'm going to see Kentucky does have a bar association. It's kybar.org and they can provide you with a legal referral in the area. Okay. Any other matters or questions I can further assist? Okay. You're welcome, ma'am. Thanks for giving Morgan a chance. Have a good day. Bye. All right. Thank you. Bye. Welcome.
