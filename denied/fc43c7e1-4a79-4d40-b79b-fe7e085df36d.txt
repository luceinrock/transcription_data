 All right. So let's go ahead and start to talk about
 the accident. So if you can't for me, what road were you driving on when the
 accident occurred? I was driving a 2017 Ford Explorer. I'm going to go ahead
 and do a few things. What road were you on? I was the video. Okay. Again,
 having a hard time, you're kind of cutting in and out again. Sorry. Spell
 the name of the road, please. VGR. VIVA. Terce of all road. Correct. Okay.
 What direction were you heading? South. All right. Thank you. What kind of.
 Get that put in. So how did the accident happen? Tell me about the accident.
 Um. Doing the least over. Don't want one 20. I say. Where could I drive? Oh,
 no. And this was at a stoplight or a stop sign? No. Um, it was just a little
 side intersection and I guess they didn't see the theater bus and I guess
 they're trying to do race or whatever, but it was a, um, red little road.
 Okay. So no stop sign, no stoplight. No. No. No. I'll take it, of course,
 you were at a complete stop before trying to get it, like get into that
 intersection. Yes, I was on the man, but I mean, I heard him coming, but I
 can move ahead and get the bus. Okay. Yeah. Yes. Okay. Yeah. I have no dash
 cam, but that's in the building. But I do have a foot. Okay. So I take it,
 of course, with the accident and how this happens. Basically, at that city
 bus in front of you, you would come to a complete stop behind that city bus.
 And they just cloud right into you. Okay. Okay. And then from that high
 speed, pretty much when they hit you, you kind of went forward into that
 city bus. Yep. That's the way. Oh, man. That's horrible. Definitely. All.
 Definitely. I'll make sure you have that information. So what I want to go
 ahead and talk now is after the collision and after everything settled. So
 what happened? I went to the hospital to stay in there for about a week. My
 wife, she died of me, the ill impact. And that's pretty much about it. I
 haven't heard background of the lease officers or insurance company
 anything. And were you like unconscious? Yes. Yes. Okay. So pretty much when
 that impact happened, and I take it again, please correct me from wrong. So
 I take it because of that impact. You hit your head. You were unconscious.
 Unresponsive. Okay. But we can open a house. Now the leave is like on my
 second date. Okay. The end of minutes. Okay. Okay. Okay. I can be just a
 moment here. I'm so sorry. All right. So let me go ahead and ask you this.
 What injuries did you sustain from the accident? Rupshirt what? I'm a
 college. Third? Yeah, you were breaking up. I heard ruptured and then I
 didn't hear what was after that. At a brain ankle, graduate, my knee and
 him. They actually what?
 I mean, I'm sorry. Can you repeat that? I said they actually died on the
 thing as well. Oh, no. Okay. Actually made the news, I'm going to take it.
 That was a personal car. It wasn't even a commercial vehicle at all. It was
 like their own personal vehicle. But, I'm going to go ahead and ask for a
 little help. Okay. Oh, no. Just because you got a car like that, it's just
 kind of drive responsible. You know, you got to be responsible. It's just
 horrible. Do you know if police did show up to the scene or not? I mean, did
 you hear anything? Yes, they're full of my mother's old man. She's probably
 the one that has all my paperwork. Okay. If you go, she hears my emergency
 contact. So I'm pretty sure my mom has all the information about the scene.
 Okay. Well, if anything, definitely try to get your hands on it or if
 anything else, we can try to get it one way or another. Let me ask you this.
 All right. So they transported you to Lexington Medical. I think it of
 course they did X-rays. Did they do any MRIs? Did they do any CT scans? I
 know. I'm going to X-ray the CT scans. Lexington, I'm pretty sure they sent
 me an email with all my paperwork. They usually do. So if I check my email,
 I'm pretty sure I have stuff in there. Lexington. Okay. So that's why I'm
 just trying to gather that information. So you got X-ray CT scans, not too
 sure if they did an MRI. Okay. What other treatment did you have to go
 through while they're at the hospital? That's why I was asking if you had
 any surgeries performed. I was like, that was it? That's best of my
 knowledge. Like I said, my mom, she probably could tell you more. She
 probably asked my paperwork. I could check my email if it's Jack. I backed
 over to you guys. I even know it. Well, if you can check your email now,
 that way we can take a look at it. That way I can go ahead and get the list
 of treatments. We can get it at another time. It's there for it to be better
 because I'm actually, I'm actually at the funeral right now. No, my fat. Oh,
 you're definitely going through a lot. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. It's
 okay. All right. So you are X-rays. CT scans. So did they do any, did they
 prescribe you any kind of medication? Well, I'm off to code on. I can be one
 second here. Okay. All right. And then you stated no surgeries were needed.
 The means of the fractured knee. They didn't have to work on it at all. They
 just had to kind of wrap it. It was going to heal on its own. Did they
 recommend any kind of specialist or anything? Oh, no, nothing. I know.
 That's I've never they done. They was touching and they asked me, could I
 still wish I did, which is her to but yeah. I feel able to. Yeah. Yeah.
 Okay. All right. Let me ask you this. No. I need help with that. Council.
 That's going to help me get through it with my wife. Okay. Okay. We'll go
 ahead and we'll continue doing this. Now, did you hear anything about the
 other party? Was it were they driving under the influence? Okay. And I'd
 take it of course your airbags to pull it. Yeah. Okay. Just too well. Okay.
 All right. If you don't mind, let me go ahead and ask you this real quick
 here. Now, are you currently previously being represented by an attorney?
 No, I'm not. Okay. Okay. All right. If you don't mind, may I go ahead and
 place you on a brief hole, Mr. Scott? Well, I go ahead and get the
 information put in. All right. Thank you. I'll be right back. Shouldn't take
 me too long. You helped me out. All right. No problem. Let's be just a
 moment.
