 Thank you for calling more in the morning speaking with George on record line. Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with this time? Hi, I have Belinda here on the line. Her son was in an atto accent and is looking for legal representation. I let you take the call from here. Thanks. Hello. Hello. Hi, my name is Belinda. Yes, you are. Real quickly, ma'am. Can I just ask you for a good number to reach you back at in case we get this connected? This is George on behalf of Morgan. Okay, it's 228. 623. 3482. All right. And real quickly here, what I would like to go ahead and do because I do here that there's a little bit of lag in the audio is I'm just going to go ahead and I'm going to redial you directly so there is a large delay in our calls. That'll can be okay. That's fine. Miss Belinda. Yes, that's okay. Oh, wow. The audio appears to be getting really messed up. I'm going to go ahead and redial. I appreciate you.
