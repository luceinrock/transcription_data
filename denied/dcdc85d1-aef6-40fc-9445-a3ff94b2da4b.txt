 I'm John Morgan. Over 30 years ago, Morgan and Morgan started with just two lawyers, but our mission started years before that. When I was younger, my brother the team had been out there and my family had been in the gut. I was hiring the wrong lawyer. And to add insult to injury, they fought him very hard. We got to see firsthand the consequences of having a life-changing injury when you're poor and when you hire a terrible lawyer. Tim got really beat up and I became outraged. And I decided then and there that I would only ever do this type of work and represent the people, not the power. Morgan and Morgan is the largest personal injury firm in the world here to serve you wherever you are, whatever you need. With an army of over 800 attorneys, thousands of caring support staff.
